        <i>TimeKeeper</i> supports a generic REST API.<br /><br />
        <b>Rooms:</b><br />
        Rooms allow you to control and specify which timers appear. This is helpful if you are running clocks in multiple venues or instances, and only want certain timers to appear on certain viewer screens.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Getting All Rooms:</i><br />
        Make a GET request to <span class="code">/api/rooms</span> to receive a JSON reply of all available rooms.<br />
        Room objects are defined as:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">"id"</span>: Unique ID generated by the server upon creation of the Room object.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"name"</span>: The friendly name of the room, displayed to the user when connecting to the viewer client.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"enabled"</span>: Boolean true/false, indicates if the Room is available for selection or not.</li>
        </ul>
        <i>Getting a specific Room:</i><br />
        Make a GET request to <span class="code">/api/room/<i>roomID</i></span>, where roomID is the ID of the room, to receive a JSON reply of the room information.<br />
        If an invalid Room ID is specified, a reply of <span class="code">{returnStatus: "invalid-room-id"}</span> will be returned.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Adding a Room:</i><br />
        Make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/room/add</span>, specifying all the Room object data, except for the ID, which will be automatically generated. The newly created Room object will be returned as a JSON reply.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Updating a Room:</i><br />
        Make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/room/<i>roomID</i></span>, where roomID is the ID of the Room object, along with a JSON Room object in the POST body. It will return the updated Room object as a JSON reply.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Deleting a Room:</i><br />
        Make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/room/delete/<i>roomID</i></span>, where roomID is the ID of the Room object.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Timers:</b><br />
        Timers are the objects that TimeKeeper will count down to, based on the viewer's current local system time.<br /><br />
        <i>Getting All Timers:</i><br />
        Make a GET request to <span class="code">/api/timers</span> to receive a JSON reply of all available timers.<br />
        <br />
        <i>Getting a specific Timer:</i><br />
        Make a GET request to <span class="code">/api/timer/<i>timerID</i></span>, where timerID is the ID of the timer, to receive a JSON reply of the room information.<br />
        If an invalid Timer ID is specified, a reply of <span class="code">{returnStatus: "invalid-timer-id"}</span> will be returned.
        <br />
        Timer objects are defined as:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">"id"</span>: Unique ID generated by the server upon creation of the Timer object.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"datetime"</span>: The datetime in epoch milliseconds that the viewer page should count down to. See JavaScript date object and the <span class="code">getTime()</span> method for more information.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"label"</span>: Friendly label to display alongside the timer, for a description.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"expireMillis"</span>: The number of milliseconds left in the countdown where the timer should start blinking red.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"publishMillis"</span>: The number of milliseconds left in the countdown where the timer should appear on the viewer page.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"roomID"</span>: The Room ID that this Timer should appear on. Specifying "room-0" means this Timer will be sent to all viewer pages regardless of the room they are viewing.</li>
        </ul>
        <i>Adding a Timer:</i><br />
        Make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/timer/add</span>, specifying all the Timer object data, except for the ID, which will be automatically generated. The newly created Timer object will be returned as a JSON reply.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Updating a Timer:</i><br />
        Make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/timer/<i>timerID</i></span>, where timerID is the ID of the Timer object, along with a JSON Timer object in the POST body. It will return the updated Timer object as a JSON reply.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Deleting a Timer:</i><br />
        Expired Timers older than 5 minutes are automatically deleted, however if you wish to manually delete a timer, make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/timer/delete/<i>timerID</i></span>, where timerID is the ID of the Timer object.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Adding a Countdown:</i><br />
        Make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/countdown/<i>roomID</i>/<i>length</i></span>, where <i>roomID</i> is the ID of the room to send the Timer to, and <i>length</i> is the number of seconds for the countdown. The newly created Timer object will be returned as a JSON reply.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Messages:</b><br />
        Messages can be sent and displayed on viewer clients.<br /><br />
        <i>Getting All Messages:</i><br />
        Make a GET request to <span class="code">/api/messages</span> to receive a JSON reply of all available Message objects.<br />
        <br />
        Message objects are defined as:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">"id"</span>: Unique ID generated by the server upon creation of the Message object.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"datetime"</span>: The datetime in epoch milliseconds that the viewer page should count down to. See JavaScript date object and the <span class="code">getTime()</span> method for more information.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"message"</span>: The actual message to display. HTML is OK to use.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"expireMillis"</span>: The number of milliseconds left in the countdown where the Message should start blinking red.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"publishMillis"</span>: The number of milliseconds left in the countdown where the Message should appear on the viewer page.</li>
            <li><span class="code">"roomID"</span>: The Room ID that this Timer should appear on. Specifying "room-0" means this Message will be sent to all viewer pages regardless of the room they are viewing.</li>
        </ul>
        <i>Adding a Message:</i><br />
        Make a POST request to <span class="code">/api/message/add</span>, specifying all the Message object data, except for the ID, which will be automatically generated. The newly created Message object will be returned as a JSON reply.
